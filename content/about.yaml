aboutData:
  description: "I am <b>Ismail Boularbah</b> aka <b>Ismailium</b>, Cuber and Frontend
    JavaScript Developer. I really like writing code and building responsive
    web apps & designs, Especially in Javascript. I enjoy projects that
    require me to use javaScript on the server-side using Next.js, React.js,
    Firebase, Restful APIS... I have been working on the web for around 4
    years building learning/freelancing projects. All i am trying to build
    in the field of the web are responsive interfaces with all devices in
    terms of resolution and size."
